The purpose of this website is to provide documentation and updates on [Viash](https://github.com/viash-io/viash), a tool that lets you turn scripts into reusable components.
This blog post aims to help you guide you in the right direction for your first steps.

### Introduction to Viash

The [Introduction page](/docs/getting_started/introduction/) acts as a starting point to the rest of the documentation. You can find instructions on how to download and run Viash on the [Installation](/docs/getting_started/installation/) page.  
For a hands-on experience with Viash, take a look at the [What is a Viash Component? page](/docs/getting_started/what_is_a_viash_component/) for a step-by-step tutorial.

### Creating a config file

Understanding how to create a configuration file is essential when you want to create your own components:

- For a general overview of the sections of the file config, take a look at the [Config File page](/docs/getting_started/what_is_a_viash_component/).
- The [Functionality page](/docs/reference_config/functionality/) explains the section of the same name.

Each supported executable platform has its own page explaining how to set up the Platform section of the config file:

- [Native](/docs/reference_config/platform-native/)
- [Docker](/docs/reference_config/platform-docker/)
- [Nextflow](/docs/reference_config/platform-nextflow/)

### Commands

Every command to run, build and test components and namespaces is detailed on these pages:

- [viash run](/docs/reference_commands/run/)
- [viash build](/docs/reference_commands/build/)
- [viash test](/docs/reference_commands/test/)
- [viash config view](/docs/reference_commands/config-view/)
- [viash ns build](/docs/reference_commands/ns-build/)
- [viash ns test](/docs/reference_commands/ns-test/)
- [viash ns list](/docs/reference_commands/ns-list/)
