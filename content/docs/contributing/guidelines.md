We welcome any contributions to this project, be it changes in

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [code of
conduct](/docs/contributing/conduct/).

## Contributing code changes to viash

### Getting started

-   Make sure you have a [GitHub
    account](https://github.com/signup/free). If you are not familar
    with git and GitHub, take a look at <http://happygitwithr.com/> to
    get started.
-   [Submit an issue](https://github.com/viash-io/viash/issues) for your
    problem or suggestion, assuming one does not already exist.
-   Clearly describe your issue, including steps to reproduce when it is
    a bug, or some justification for a proposed improvement.
-   [Fork the
    repository](https://github.com/viash-io/viash/network/members) on
    GitHub to make a copy of the repository on your account.

### Making changes

Here are some helpful tips to make the development cycle easier:

-   viash is written primarily in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
    We recommend using [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    as your IDE, but you’re free to use alternatives.
-   While editing the files, save often and make commits of logical
    units where every commits indicates a single concept.
-   Make sure to [write good commit
    messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
-   If you need help or guidance, post an update on [your
    issue](https://github.com/viash-io/viash/issues).

### Submit your changes

Before opening a pull request, make sure you review and agree with the
guidelines below:

-   Is the change important and ready enough to ask the community to
    spend time reviewing?
-   Have you searched for [existing, related pull
    requests](https://github.com/viash-io/viash/pulls)?
-   Is the change being proposed clearly explained and motivated?
-   When you contribute code, you affirm that the contribution is your
    original work and that you license the work to the project under the
    project’s open source license. Whether or not you state this
    explicitly, by submitting any copyrighted material via pull request,
    email, or other means you agree to license the material under the
    project’s open source license and warrant that you have the legal
    authority to do so.

To submit your changes, push to your fork and [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/viash-io/viash/pulls).  
From this point on, you are waiting for us to review and comment on your
pull request. We try to do this within a few days and may suggest
improvements or ask for clarification.

## Contributing to viash in other ways

### Help others

A great way of contributing is helping others by providing answers and
suggestions on [their issues](https://github.com/viash-io/viash/issues).

### Test new releases

We release new versions of viash periodically that introduce
improvements, features and bug fixes. Before releasing a production
release, we have beta and release candidates available.  
You can contribute by using one of the aforementioned releases and
reporting (and fixing) any bugs you encounter.

### Report bugs

Ideally, bug reports are accompanied by a proposed code change to fix
the bug. This isn’t always possible, as those who discover a bug may not
have the experience to fix it.  
Bug reports are only useful however if they include enough information
to understand, isolate and ideally reproduce the bug.

When submitting a bug report, add the following:

-   A clear description of the bug.
-   The exact steps needed to reproduce the bug.
-   Include a file or an example if needed.

### Review changes

Changes proposed via pull requests are public, so anyone can see and
comment on the changes.  
You can make suggestions here and point out problems, as small as typos
or issues of style.

### Report documentation issues and suggestions

The documentation you are reading now is hosted on our [viash web
repository](https://github.com/viash-io/viash_web). If you encounter any
gaps in our documentation or you have spotted a mistake, you can help us
out by [creating an
issue](https://github.com/viash-io/viash_web/issues/).
