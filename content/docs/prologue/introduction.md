<!-- TODO: What is viash if you would describe it in one or two sentences?
viash is a ... -->

By providing some meta-data regarding its functionality and the platform
on which you want to run the software, viash can help you:

-   Wrap your script in an executable with a CLI and `--help`
    functionality.
-   Seamlessly execute your component natively on the host platform or
    in a **Docker** container.
-   Combine multiple components in a **Nextflow** pipeline.
-   Unit-test your component to ensure that it works at all times.

## Example use cases

Here are a few use cases which serve as motivation for viash:

<!-- TODO: Rewrite use cases, the reason why viash helps in those situations should be crystal clear to someone that has never seen viash before, this part of the docs is presented before the installation after all. Ideally each of these should have "viash can help here by../In this case, viash can.../etc." -->

-   You want to combine several tools in a pipeline and every tool has
    specific requirements on how they should be run. Even worse: some
    requirements might directly conflict with each other.
-   Your next data analysis project is very similar to the previous
    project, so you copy and paste the source code. Unfortunately, you
    detect a bug in some of your code, so now you need to go back and
    fix the same bug in all the different projects.
-   You want to look back at a data analysis you performed two years
    ago. Unfortunately, the software you used back then is not supported
    anymore, or the newest version produces totally different results.
    With viash you can package the older version together with its
    dependencies in an executable so you donâ€™t have to worry about
    conflicts or deprecated versions
-   You developed a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook report for
    a data analysis. You wish to share it with your colleague, only to
    spend two hours installing your [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/)
    stack on their laptop.
