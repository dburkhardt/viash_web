Since version 0.4.0, Viash supports modifying a [viash config](/docs/reference_config/config/) YAML 
at runtime using a custom DSL. This allows making dynamic changes to your components or projects.
All Viash subcommands have support for the DSL through the `-c|--config_mod` parameter.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


The easiest way to explain is perhaps by showing some examples. The following statements are all valid under the DSL definition.

Changing the version of a component:
```
.functionality.version := "0.3.0"
```

Changing the registry of docker containers.
```
.platforms[.type == "docker"].container_registry := "url-to-registry"
```

Adding an author to the list:
```
.functionality.authors += { name: "Mr. T", role: "sponsor" }
```

These commands come in really handy when building a lot of components, for example using the following command:
```bash
viash ns build \
  -c '.functionality.version := "0.3.0"' \
  -c '.platforms[.type == "docker"].container_registry := "url-to-registry"' \
  -c '.functionality.authors += { name: "Mr. T", role: "sponsor" }'
```
