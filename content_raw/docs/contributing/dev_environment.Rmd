## Building from source

The following needs to be installed on your system in order to install viash:

- GNU [Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html#Autotools-Introduction)
- OpenJDK
- [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)

To build and install viash, run the following commands.
```bash
./configure --prefix=~
make
make install
```

If you wish to install viash for all users and not just yourself, run the following commands instead.
```bash
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

To verify your installation, run the following command:

```bash
viash --help
```

## Building from source using docker

If you have Java and Docker installed (but not `sbt`), run this instead:

```bash
./configure --prefix=~
make docker
make install
```

To verify your installation, run the following command:

```bash
viash --help
```
