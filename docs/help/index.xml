Why is this? In Linux, files created by Docker are owned by root by default.
You can set up the chown attribute in your config file to automatically transfer the ownership of files to the user running the component. Any file output where an argument of the type file with an output direction was used will also have their ownership transferred.</description></item></channel></rss>
